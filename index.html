<p> Hello! As you may know my name is Blake Hause. I was born and raised, right here in London Ontario. Most of family live here in Ontario but much of my dad's family are located on the east coast of Newfoundland in a small fishing town called St. Lawrence. It's a wierd and long story but most of my family out east spell our last name "Hawse" instead of "Hause", due to the lack of reading and writing skills during WWI. As a kid I was in love with the water–I still am to this day– and I spent most of my time there either in our pool, the ocean, or the lake. My dad was the same way and was part of the Ontario swim team when he was younger, so it was something that was in my blood. I completed all swimmming levels including bronze medalion and bronze cross by the age of fourteen. At that time I was too young to complete my NLS (you have to be 16yrs of age) so I volounteered at northridge pool for two summers instead. So yes I can positively say that swimming and being anywhere near water is probably my greatest passion. Some of my other hobbies include Snowboarding, skateboarding, camping, hiking, basically anything outdoors. It is kind of ironic that I am taking this course because I have never been someone capable of sitting down and staying completely focused on something for long periods of time. I think this is my greatest struggle. Although I struggle with staying focused for long periods of time, I took this course because I absolutely love beautiful website's and I have a passion for photography, video, clothing/branding, and creating stunning visuals. I believe if i complete this course it will guide me towards finding a career that i am passionate about.</p>
